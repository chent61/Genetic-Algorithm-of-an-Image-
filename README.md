In a genetic algorithm, a population of individuals evolves over time. The stronger individuals
reproduce, and the weaker ones die. The surviving ones can also mutate. With each
individual, there is a fitness number that indicates how strong that individual is. For more
details, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm. A genetic algorithm
terminates when a given number of iterations is reached or when a solution is found, that
is, an individual with certain fitness.
The goal of this assignment is to compute an image, using a basic genetic algorithm
approach, that is close to a given image.
